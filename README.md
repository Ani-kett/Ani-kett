### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I’m **Aniket**, a graphic designer and software engineer based in India. I like building clean, modern websites and apps with smooth animation and UX.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- React, TypeScript, Tailwind
- UI design with subtle motion
- Small, thoughtful projects with polish
